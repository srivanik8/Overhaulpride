# Overhaulpride

## Inspiration
In the current scenario it is really important to stay updated .Queer community right now is very active and the people around the world are working towards its betterment .it is really happy to see their work for the community and we were a lot inspired by all those community members who work hard for the welfare of people who are not aware leading  us towards this project

when we were thinking about the project ideas to help the queer community we have noticed how there are a lot of people who dont have any awareness regarding the community .Our project aims on giving the updates about queer community through polls,requests,suggestions we give you all the information and updates regarding pride community

## What it Does🏫
Our project aims to address the issue of problems and updates regarding the pride community and focus on concerns about pride besides the articles help them know themselves and also give them a sense of positivity . 🍽 We accomplish this by news articles and  instagram community research where we have asked a lot of questions and conducted some questionnaires's. Additionally, it helps the people who donot know about them and also it motivates . 📋🏢 This way, we ensure the people to be updates and aware all ay every day. 😊

Furthermore, our page also focuses on the positivity of the pride . While the LGBTQ community gears up for in-person events, our platform can help you show your pride online. Almost any real-life community can find its analogue online, but the importance of the this platform to the queer community is profound. LGBTQ people have long found a home on the Internet, connecting with likeminded people all around the country and the world. Online queer communities help people feel less alone, especially if they’re not out to their families or can’t safely come out where they live. For as long as our platform have existed, queer folks have used them to meet friends, lovers, and build unflappable networks centered around shared pride.. 🍽🌍
